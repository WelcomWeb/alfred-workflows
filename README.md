# A collection of Alfred2 Workflows

## Sublime Text 2 ([Download Workflow](https://github.com/WelcomWeb/alfred-workflows/raw/master/sublime-text-2/sublime-text-2.alfredworkflow))
A simple workflow to quickly open Sublime Text 2 with a project folder.

First, set up your root project folder. As an example I have most projects under `~/Development/Projects` so I set it as;

![Setting up 'subl'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WelcomWeb/alfred-workflows/master/assets/setting-up-subl.png)

Now Alfred can quickly access your projects, and you can open them with Sublime Text 2 by running

    subl <PROJECT NAME>

You will get autocomplete suggestions as you type.

**Note!** This requires Sublime Text 2 to be installed at the default location, i.e. "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl".
