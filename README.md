# A collection of Alfred2 Workflows

## Sublime Text 2
A simple workflow to quickly open Sublime Text 2 with a project folder

First, set up your root project folder. As an example I have most projects under `~/Development/Projects` so I set as;

    ![Setting up 'subl'](https://github.com/WelcomWeb/alfred-workflows/assets/setting-up-subl.png)

Now Alfred can quickly access your projects, and you can open them with Sublime Text 2 by running

    subl <PROJECT NAME>

You will get autocomplete suggestions as you type.
