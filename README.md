# A collection of Alfred2 Workflows

## Sublime Text 2 ([Download Workflow](https://github.com/WelcomWeb/alfred-workflows/raw/master/sublime-text-2/sublime-text-2.alfredworkflow))
A simple workflow to quickly open Sublime Text 2 with a project folder.

First, set up your root project folder. As an example I have most projects under `~/Development/Projects` so I set it as;

Now Alfred can quickly access your projects, and you can open them with Sublime Text 2 by running

    subl <PROJECT NAME>

You will get autocomplete suggestions as you type.

You can also open a custom path, of course;
